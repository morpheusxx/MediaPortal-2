  <States>
    <!-- Register here all workflow states of your plugin. Each workflow state corresponds to
         a certain UI state. The id is needed to be able to reference the state, for example in the action which
         navigates to this state, see in file my-plugin-actions.xml.

         The file name of this file must be unique among all possible plugins, so chose a much more meaningful name
         than "my-plugin-states.xml".

         The Id uniquely identifies the state among all workflow states. Use a GUID generator to create
         a new state id. The id is referenced from workflow actions which lead to this state as well as from
         code which tells the WorkflowManager to push a workflow state onto the workflow navigation stack.

         The name of the state is only needed for debug reasons and will not be shown to the user.

         The MainScreen will automatically be shown by the workflow manager when switching to the state.
         It is also possible for a workflow model to set the screen programmatically in its UpdateScreen method.

         The DisplayLabel is the string which is shown in the Navigation bar for this state. -->
    <WorkflowState Id="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
        Name="MyPluginMainState" MainScreen="my_main_screen"
        DisplayLabel="[MyPlugin.StateDisplayLabel]"/> <!-- No workflow model -->
  </States>
</Workflow>
